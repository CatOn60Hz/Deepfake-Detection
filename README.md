# Deepfake Detection System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Deepfake Detection System** is an advanced deep learning pipeline designed for image forgery detection. It utilizes a **fine-tuned InceptionResNetV1 model**, trained on deepfake and authentic image datasets, to classify images as real or fake. The model leverages **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and **fully connected layers** for binary classification. Integrated **Grad-CAM visualization** provides interpretability, and a **Gradio-based web interface** enables easy testing. The system supports **CUDA acceleration** for enhanced performance.
